# Infinity Wallet Crypto Information

## Overview
This repository contains a collection of information from chains and tokens, allowing projects to receive custom styles and further information, visible when imported by a user into the Infinity Wallet and other platforms.

This allows any token to gain additional credibility and a professional feel when manually imported across the ecosystem, while providing them with:
- Custom designed logo of the token.
- Custom color within the Infinity Wallet.
- Fiat price display for the token within the Infinity Wallet.
- Coin info section themed style in the Infinity Wallet.


## Documentation

For more information on adding a token, see the [Documentation](https://docs.shardcoin.io/contact-us/listings-and-whitelistings/listing#token-custom-list-integration)

## Submission Fee
Integration only requires a 2,500 Shard fee which is burned. This is to cover the design costs for custom assets and future updates, along with the time taken to verify and validate projects. Additionally, it ensures that projects integrating support the Infinity Wallet.
