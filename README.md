# Infinity Wallet Crypto Information

## Overview
This repository contains a collection of information from chains and tokens, allowing projects to receive custom styles and further information, visible when imported by a user into the Infinity Wallet and other platforms.

- Custom designed logo of the token.
- Custom color within the Infinity Wallet.
- Fiat price display for the token within the Infinity Wallet.
- Coin info section themed style in the Infinity Wallet.
